**1.1 Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.

{% highlight python %}
 def allUnique(str):
    """Space 2n, runtime N"""
    s = Set()
    for char in str:
        char in s:
            return False
        s.add(char)
    return True

{% endhighlight %}
    

**1.2 Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. 

{% highlight python %}

# Transform both strings into common form and compare
def checkPermutations(str1, str2):
    """ Space (2(len(str1) + len(str2))), Assuming sorted is efficient  """ 
    if len(str1) != len(str2):
        return False
    return ''.join(sorted(str1)) == ''.join(sorted(str2))
    
{% endhighlight %}

**1.3 URLify:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20' You may assume that the string has sufficient space (not applicable to python) at the end to hold the additional characters, and that yuou are given the "true" length of the string. 

```
Example 
input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
```
{% highlight python %}
def URLify(str):
    url = ''
    for char in str:
        if char == ' ':
            url = url + '%20'
        else: 
            url = url + char
    return url

{% endhighlight %}

**1.4 Palindrome Permutation:** Given a string, write a function to check if its a permutation of a palindrome. a palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 

```
Example 
input: Tact Coa
output: True ("taco cat", "acto tca")
```

{% highlight python %}
from sets import Set

def canBePalindrome(str):
    """Check if characters appear an even number of times and has 0/1 odd character """
    s =  Set()
    for char in str:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char not in s:
                s.add(char)
            else:
                s.remove(char)
    return len(s) <= 1

{% endhighlight %}

**1.5 One Away:** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, check if they are one or zero edits away. 

{% highlight python %}
def oneAway(str1, str2):
    
    
{% endhighlight %}

**1.6 String Compression:** Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. 

**1.7 Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 Degrees. In place?

**1.8 Zero Matrix:** Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

**1.9 String Rotation:** Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2 write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to `isSubstring`.
