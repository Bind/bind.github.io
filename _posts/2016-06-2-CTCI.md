**1.1 Is Unique:** Implement an algorithm to determein if a string has all unique characters.

**1.2 Check Permutation:** Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other. 

**1.3 URLify:** Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20' You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that yuou are given the "true" length of the string. 
```
Example 
input: "Mr John Smith    ", 13
output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"
```

**1.4 Palindrome Permutation:** Given a string, write a function to check if its a permutation of a palindrome. a palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. 

```
Example 
input: Tact Coa
output: True ("taco cat", "acto tca")
```

**1.5 One Away:** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, check if they are one or zero edits away. 

**1.6 String Compression:** Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`. 

**1.7 Rotate Matrix:** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 Degrees. In place?

**1.8 Zero Matrix:** Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.

**1.9 String Rotation:** Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2 write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to `isSubstring`.
